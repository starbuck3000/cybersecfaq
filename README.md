## Web technology 
### Cookies
#### How should I secure my cookies?
Sensitive cookies (e.g. session cookie) should be protected *at least* with the following attributes:
- 'secure' --> forces transmission over HTTPS only.
- 'httpOnly' --> prevents interactive access from local JavaScript.
- 'expires' --> defines an automatic expiration date.
- 'domain' --> restricts the domains, and in particular, subdomains, to which it can be transmitted.
- 'path' --> restricts the Urls to which the cookie will be sent. Important when multiple apps are running on the same server.
- 'samesite' --> defines whether the cookie will be included in cross-site requests.

### Local storage
#### Is localStorage / sessionStorage secure?
Access to localStorage/sessionStorage objects is filtered per origin, similar to a SOP. Only code running from the same origin itself can access the content of the local storage. If "secure" meant "protected from XSS attacks", the answer is no: local storage can be manipulated when under a successful XSS attack. As a principle, storage of confidential/sensitive data in localStorage/sessionStorage should be avoided.
